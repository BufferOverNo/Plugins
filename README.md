# Hey hi hello

Nothing too fancy here, just my automated plugins.

Thanks to Oiuyo / OliVorkath for the inspiration and special attack logic. 

Updates will be slow as I'm still learning.

How to use AutoVorki:  
(Currently only supports melee and will stop upon death)
1. Start off with house tabs / cons cape in invent
2. Already have your armour equipped
3. Requires max ornate pool and portal nexus with left click Moonclan tele OR moonclan portal
4. Set up your quickprayers
5. Good luck have fun

How to use AutoContinue (wip):
1. Turn it on
2. Easy enough right

How to use AutoOffer:
1. Runes for demonic/sinister can be from invent or rune pouch
2. Be on arceuus spellbook
3. Make sure soulbearer has charges

How to use AutoTrade:  
(currently bugged if your username has a space)
1. Input the item ID you'd like to trade (currently does not work with noted)
2. Input the player you will receive a trade from
3. That's it!  
Upon sending a trade req to the account with this enabled, it will run to the nearest bank, withdraw the requested item and trade it the player

How to use AutoBasalt:
1. Either start in the mines on Weiss or at the top of the stairs near Snowflake
2. Select the options you require
3. Hit start
