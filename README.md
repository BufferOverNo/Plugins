# Hey hi hello

Nothing too fancy here, just my first automated plugin.

Thanks to Oiuyo / OliVorkath for the inspiration and special attack login. 

Probably won't update this much / at all, but it could be a decent base.

Currently only supports melee and will stop upon death.

How to use:
1. Start off with house tabs / cons cape in invent
2. Already have your armour equipped
3. Requires max ornate pool and portal nexus with left click Moonclan tele OR moonclan portal
4. Set up your quickprayers
5. Good luck have fun
